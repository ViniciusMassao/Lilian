Making my way downtown.
Walking fast.
Faces passed.
And I'm home bound.
Staring blankly ahead.
Just making my way.
Making my way.
Through the crowd.
And I need you.
And I miss you.
And now I wonder.
If I could fall.
Into the sky.
Do you think time.
Would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk.
A thousand miles.
If I could.
Just see you.
Tonight.
It's always times like these.
When I think of you.
And I wonder if you ever.
Think of me.
Cause everything's so wrong.
And I don't belong.
Living in your.
Precious memories.
'Cause I need you.
And I miss you.
And now I wonder.
If I could fall.
Into the sky.
Do you think time.
Would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk.
A thousand miles.
If I could.
Just see you.
Tonight.
And I, I, don't want to let you know.
I, I, drown in your memory.
I, I, don't want to let this go.
I, I, don't.
Making my way downtown.
Walking fast.
Faces passed.
And I'm home bound.
Staring blankly ahead.
Just making my way.
Making my way.
Through the crowd.
And I still need you.
And I still miss you.
And now I wonder.
If I could fall.
Into the sky.
Do you think time.
Would pass us by.
'Cause you know I'd walk.
A thousand miles.
If I could.
Just see you.
If I could fall.
Into the sky.
Do you think time.
Would pass me by.
'Cause you know I'd walk.
A thousand miles.
If I could.
Just see you.
If I could.
Just hold you.
Tonight.
Wise men say.
Only fools rush in.
But I can't help.
Falling in love with you.
Shall I stay.
Would it be a sin.
If I can't help.
Falling in love with you?
Like a river flows.
Surely to the sea.
Darling, so it goes.
Some things are meant to be.
Take my hand.
Take my whole life too.
For I can't help.
Falling in love with you.
Like a river flows.
Surely to the sea.
Darling, so it goes.
Some things are meant to be.
Take my hand.
Take my whole life too.
For I can't help.
Falling in love with you.
For I can't help.
Falling in love with you.
Home is where you make it.
From a distance I feel lost, you can tell.
Cause all the frames have been replaced and off the shelf.
Chasing shadows as they follow me, but I can’t catch what I can’t see.
Feeling so detached from what I know.
I’m living the truth, you’re speaking in lies.
It’s getting easier to say goodbye.
The harder I try, the farther I fall.
Away from the place I called my own.
I will never know what happens next.
Even when my heart beats out my chest.
Through all of the chaos, I’ll find a way out.
I know home is where you make it.
I will always fight for one more breath.
Even in a cardiac arrest.
Through all of the chaos, I’ll find a way out.
I know home is where you make it.
Home is where you make it.
How could you turn your back on your own?
Cast out left to walk alone.
Now I see who you are, did you think I would get this far?
And when it’s all said and done.
I will never know what happens next.
Even when my heart beats out my chest.
Through all of the chaos, I’ll find a way out.
I know home is where you make it.
I will always fight for one more breath.
Even in a cardiac arrest.
Through all of the chaos, I’ll find a way out.
I know home is where you make it.
The time is now, it’s now.
I’ll stand on my own, I’ve got some shit to say and this is how it goes.
One, you shut me out of everything you do.
Two, the hell you put me through.
Three, you never would accept me.
I’m letting go.
I will never know, know what happens next.
I can feel my heart, heart beat out my chest.
I will always fight for one more breath.
Even in a cardiac arrest.
Through all of the chaos, I’ll find a way out.
I know home is where you make it.
Even when I feel my heart beat out my chest.
Hey, where's the drums?
Wooo oh.
Let's go!
Woo, girl, you're shining.
Like a 5th Avenue diamond.
And they don't make you like they used to.
You're never going out of style.
Woo, pretty baby.
This world might have gone crazy.
The way you saved me, who could blame me.
When I just wanna make you smile.
I wanna thrill you like Michael.
I want to kiss you like Prince.
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye, like Hathaway.
Write a song for you like this.
You' re over my head, I'm out of my mind.
Thinking I was born in the wrong time.
One of a kind, living in a world gone plastic.
Baby, you're so classic (yea yea).
(Gone plastic).
Baby, you're so classic (yea yea).
Baby, you.
Baby, you're so classic.
Four dozen roses.
Anything for you to notice.
All the way to serenade you.
Doing in Sinatra style.
Ima pick you up in a Cadillac.
Like a gentleman, bringin' glamour back.
Keep it real to real in the way I feel.
I could walk you down the aisle.
I wanna thrill you like Michael.
I want to kiss you like Prince.
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye, like Hathaway.
Write a song for you like this.
You're over my head, I'm out of my mind.
Thinking I was born in the wrong time.
It's like a rewind, everything is so throwback-ish.
I kinda like it like it.
Out of my league, old school chic.
Like a moviestar from a silver screen.
You're one of a kind, living in a world gone plastic.
Baby, you're so classic (yea yea).
Baby, you're so classic (yea yea).
Baby, you're so classic.
Baby you're class, and, baby, you're sic.
I never met a girl like you ever 'til we met.
A star in the 40s, centerfold in the 50s'.
Got met trippin' out like the 60s - hippies.
Queen of the discotheque.
A 70s dream and a 80s best.
Hepburn, Beyoncé, Marilyn, Massey.
Girl you're timeless.
Just so classic!
You' re over my head, I'm out of my mind.
Thinking I was born in the wrong time.
It's not a rewind, everything is so throwback yea.
I kinda like it like it.
Out of my league, old school chic.
Like a moviestar from a silver screen.
You're one of a kind, living in a world gone plastic.
Baby, you're so classic (whoa oh).
Baby, you're so classic (yea yea).
Baby, you're so classic.
Ooooh.
They say: Oh my God, I see the way you shine.
Take your hand, my dear, and place them both in mine.
You know you stopped me dead when I was passing by.
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time.
Ooh, I see you, see you, see you every time.
And oh my, I, I, I, I like your style.
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry.
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time.
So I say.
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh, oh, oh.
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before.
They say.
Move for me, move for me, move for me, ay-ay-ay.
And when you’re done I'll make you do it all again.
I said: Oh my God, I see you walking by.
Take my hands, my dear, and look me in my eyes.
Just like a monkey, I've been dancing my whole life.
And you just beg to see me dance just one more time.
Ooh, I see you, see you, see you every time.
And I, I, I, I like your style.
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry.
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time.
So they say.
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh, oh, oh.
I’ve never seen anybody do the things you do before.
They say.
Move for me, move for me, move for me, ay-ay-ay.
And when you're done I'll make you do it all again.
They say.
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh.
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before.
They say.
Move for me, move for me, move for me, ay-ay-ay.
And when you're done I'll make you do it all again.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
(Do it all again, do it all again, do it all again).
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh.
(Do it all again, do it all again, do it all again).
Ooh, ah-ah, ah-ah.
They say.
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh oh oh.
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before.
They say.
Move for me, move for me, move for me, ay-ay-ay.
And when you're done I’ll make you do it all again.
They say.
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh.
I’ve never seen anybody do the things you do before.
They say.
Move for me, move for me, move for me, ay-ay-ay.
And when you're done I’ll make you do it all again.
All again.
I will fight.
I will fight for you.
I always do until my heart is black and blue.
I will stay.
I will stay with you.
We'll make it to the other side like lovers do.
I'll reach my hands out in the dark.
And wait for yours to interlock.
I'll wait for you.
I'll wait for you.
'Cause I'm not givin' up.
I'm not givin' up, givin' up, no, not yet (not yet).
Even when I'm down on my last breath (last breath).
Even when they say there's nothin' left (nothin' left).
So don't give up on.
I'm not givin' up.
I'm not givin' up, givin' up, no, not me (not me).
Even when nobody else believes (believes).
I'm not goin' down that easily.
So don't give up on me.
And I will hold.
I'll hold onto you.
No matter what this world will throw.
It won't shake me loose.
I'll reach my hands out in the dark.
And wait for yours to interlock.
I'll wait for you.
I'll wait for you.
'Cause I'm not givin' up.
I'm not givin' up, givin' up, no, not yet (not yet).
Even when I'm down on my last breath (last breath).
Even when they say there's nothin' left (nothin' left).
So don't give up on.
I'm not givin' up.
I'm not givin' up, givin' up, no, not me (not me).
Even when nobody else believes (believes).
I'm not goin' down that easily.
So don't give up on me.
I will fight.
I will fight for you.
I always do until my heart is black and blue.
Here I am waking up, still can't sleep on your side.
There's your coffee cup, the lipstick stain fades with time.
If I can dream long enough, you'd tell me I'd be just fine.
I'll be just fine.
So I drown it out like I always do.
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you.
And I chase it down, with a shot of truth.
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you.
Cleaning up today, found that old Zepplin shirt.
You wore when you ran away, and no one could feel your hurt.
We're too young, too dumb, to know things like love.
But I know better now, better now.
So I drown it out like I always do.
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you.
And I chase it down, with a shot of truth.
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you.
Too young, too dumb.
To know things like love.
Too young, too dumb.
So I drown it out like I always do.
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you.
And I chase it down, with a shot of truth.
That my feet don't dance like they did with you.
